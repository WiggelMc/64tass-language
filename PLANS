create file watcher on client

client sends package to server on change, create, delete [figure out how]

on start all files are sent to server


use multiple ways to watch files (client and server) and fallback if one doesnt work
replace fs on server with more reliable node js solution

server can read files directly from file system or use TextDocument depending on whats available

maybe:
    let the server do everything thats not editor changes
    let the client initialize everything (send file contents) thats open in the editor (maybe only incremental changes)

incremental change processing (only needed for changes in the editor) [figure out how]
