let the server do everything thats not editor changes
let the client initialize everything (send file contents) thats open in the editor (maybe only incremental changes)

-----------------------------------------

incremental change processing (only needed for changes in the editor) [figure out how]


open files are stored in a map and will be ignored in fs updates

When a file is opened, the version and lines are stored (lines into array)


2 options:
    always calculate syntax highlighting (faster load when opening a file, slower indexing, more memory)
        indexing will only happen once
            

    only calculate syntax highlighting when open (slower load when opening a file, faster indexing, less memory)
        complete file will be parsed again when opened (only definitions, includes, scopes, etc are stored)


How to store data about a file [needs thinking]
how much should a textmate grammar be used (if at all)
how to implement different instruction sets


-----------------------


TODO

Test how syntax highlighting works in git/override diff

Find a way to
    Update the Semantic Highlights for a file (open file only)
    

maybe use codeLens
    to show information from list file next to source Code
    to show scope of a function or section
